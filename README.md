# Work Day Scheduler

![Example 3](./day-scheduler.gif) 

In the UCLA Coding Bootcamp students were challenged with creating a scheduler application that would be responsive, color dynamic and data persistent so that user responses are saved to the browseer's local storage once save buttons were clicked. Students were only allowed to use HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project.

The application was first tackled by creating the following pseudocode. I find it helpful to create a pseudocode map prior to starting any project.

# HTML: 
- Page contains typical HTML elements (header, body, h1 etc.)
- Page contains buttons and inputs

# CSS: 
- Current work day is on the top of the application
- All hours from 9AM to 5PM are on the left side of the screen
- Comment box for each hour is in the middle of the screen
- Buttons are all on the right side of the screen 

# Javascript: 
- Upon clicking save, user notes are saved to local storage within the same comment box
- If hour is past, dynamically change css of comment box to grey
- If hour is present, dynamically change css of comment box to red
- if hour is future, dynamically change css of comment box to green

# How to Use or Test? 
- Download repository to and open index.html file on your local machine
- Open hosted sample site https://eurbaezjr.github.io/day-scheduler/
